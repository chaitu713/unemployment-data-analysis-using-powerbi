# Unemployment Data Analysis using PowerBI

  - This dataset contains the information of various unemployed citizens through various like what is gender, what are age categories & what are the different features of citizens who have lost their jobs
  - On the basis of that, we can find out the most vulnerable groups by basis of these characteristics who have been unemployed.
  
  The steps I followed in this project are :
  
    1. Imported the project and Transformed the Data like modifying the Date column into 2 columns as Month and Year, from then I have merged the Month and Year columns to make them ready for Analysis.
    2. Created necessary visualizations such as Line Chart, Stacked Column Chart, KPI cards and Donut charts to display the insights I found from the Data.
    3. Published the project to PowerBI Service to share it to people online.
